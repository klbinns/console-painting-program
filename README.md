# Console Painting Program
# Author: Kyle Binns
A simple console version of a painting problem

This program uses Gradle to compile, run tests and execute.

Use the following commands:

Compile:
```
./gradlew assemble
```

Run all the unit tests (report is generated in the ./build/reports directory):
```
./gradlew build
```

Run:
```
./gradlew run -q
```
Note: the -q switch is important if you plan to run this using Gradle. It suppresses the Gradle output and allows for proper user input and output.
